            Once more, my name is Teraya and I’m a third-year Information technology major! As I've progressed through my degree at KSU I've learned so much and grown equally as much as an individual. I think I'm genuinely the definition of a big dreamer, and through my experiences, I've learned so many new ways to apply my creativity. I have a deep love for community, and fortunately I’ve been able to find many opportunities to build community as well as simply bring more joy into the lives of my peers. I definitely see myself continuing to give back to as many communities as I can in this lifetime.

            I was raised in Georgia, and I’d probably consider it as my home but if we’re being honest it depends on the day. I love traveling and I’ve often dreamed of a more nomadic lifestyle. My attention span is unfortunately absolutely horrid, but I’d love to learn more languages so I can expand the amount of people I’ll be able to genuinely meet and connect with. I have a deep love for people, and I think everyone is an extensive library of cool information just waiting to be unearthed.

            Overall, I am a lover and appreciator of all the beautiful things life has to offer. I hope to one day make a lot of really amazing contributions to music and I very much consider music the love of my life. If community is my heart, then music is my soul. I produce, sing/rap, and I'm learning to DJ (though aren’t we all? Lol).  I love nature and sitting outside is one of my favorite ways to ground myself from the sometimes seemingly endless things life has to throw at us. Fashion is another one of my many loves and I aspire to have a stunning wardrobe, which for me contains a lot of color, leather, boots, and accessories (Lenny Kravitz, Jimi Hendrix, and various punk/rock figures are my style icons if you couldn’t tell). I also love poetry, videography, editing, and most forms of design.
